    "   - Identify which demographic variables (e.g., age, gender) correlate most strongly with customer churn rates.\n",
    "##### 2. How does the type of contract impact customer churn rates?  \n",
    "   - Determine the effect of contract duration (Month-to-Month, One year, Two year) on customer churn likelihood.\n",
    "##### 3. What is the relationship between service usage patterns and customer churn likelihood?  \n",
    "   - Analyze how usage of specific services (e.g., OnlineSecurity, TechSupport) influences the probability of customer churn.\n",
    "##### 4. How do financial factors (MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges) affect customer churn?  \n",
    "   - Assess the impact of financial variables (MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges) on customer retention and churn behavior.\n",

The initial 3000 records were accessed from a Microsoft SQL Server database via pyodbc and the second dataset,was obtained from a GitHub repository and stored locally in the project's data folder. The third dataset, intended for testing purposes, is sourced from a OneDrive location. These datasets are loaded and merged into Jupyter notebooks for exploration and preprocessing before model development."
